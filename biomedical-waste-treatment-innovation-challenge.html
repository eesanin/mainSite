We are presenting India’s first incinerator powered using renewable biomass Agri waste pellets (no deforestation and fossil-fuel-free operation). Reduced operational cost and go green.
The heat recovery module converts generated heat(usually dumped into the atmosphere as waste) into electricity/steam/hot water. 
India’s first Inbuilt Continuous emission monitor(CEM) in a small scale incinerator brings down emissions to limits below the pollution control board prescribed numbers making it safer to operate in Hospital complexes.

Who recommended Temperatures for incinerators.
Primary chamber 540 to 980 C 
Secondary chamber >1000/1100* C (Indian and Thai standards) 

We are the only biomass Agri waste pellets burner manufacturer in India to reach 1150 °C consistently during operation.
Our Pellet Burners are deployed in steel plants and aluminium melting units which is a proof for our claim.
This makes our pellet burners an ideal candidate to replace the conventional Diesel/Furnace oil burner fired incinerators.
Diesel/Furnace oil/ electricity -based incinerators are 40% costlier to operate when compared to Pellet fired incinerators.
Our incinerators can be equipped with a heat recovery module: Steam boiler.
If a steam engine is connected waste heat can be converted to electricity. A 500kg per hour continuous incineration unit can generate enough heat to power 15 households approx.
